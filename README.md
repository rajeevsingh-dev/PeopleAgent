# PeopleAgent

PeopleAgent - Intelligent Microsoft 365 User Information Assistant
A GenAI-powered conversational Chat AI that combines Microsoft Graph API data with Azure OpenAI to provide natural language interactions about Microsoft 365 users.


## Core Architecture
The application operates in three main flows:

#### 1. Query Analysis (Azure OpenAI)

- Interprets natural language queries
- Determines required data categories (profile, manager, devices, etc.)
- Converts user intent into structured API requests

#### 2. Data Retrieval (Microsoft Graph API)

- Fetches user information using application permissions
- Supports multiple data endpoints:
- User profiles and basic information
- Organizational structure (managers/reports)
- Device inventory
- Document access
- Team collaborations

#### 3. Response Generation (Azure OpenAI)

- Processes raw API data through LLM
- Generates natural language responses
- Provides conversational context management

## Features

- Microsoft Graph API integration
- User information retrieval
- Delegated access - sample code
- Application-level - sample code
- PeopleAgent - to provide user information
