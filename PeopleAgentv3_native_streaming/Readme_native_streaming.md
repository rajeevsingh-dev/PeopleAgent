# Native Streaming Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to implement native streaming for PeopleAgent. The new native streaming features are located in the `PeopleAgentv3_native_streaming` folder. Below is an overview of the modifications compared to the earlier PeopleAgentV3 version.

## Overview

- **Earlier Version:**  
  The PeopleAgentV3 implementation processed responses synchronously with a single full response payload.

- **New Version:**  
  The latest implementation in `PeopleAgentv3_native_streaming` leverages native streaming, enabling partial responses to be sent to the UI as soon as they are received from Azure OpenAI. This approach improves overall responsiveness and allows for progressively updating the chat display.

## Key Changes

1. **Streaming Response Generation:**
   - **Method:** `generate_response_streaming()` in `response_generation.py`
   - **Summary:**
     - Builds the message payload using a system prompt and conversation history.
     - Invokes the Azure OpenAI client with `stream=True`—ensuring adherence to Azure best practices—so that responses are streamed in real time.
     - Returns a Python generator that yields individual JSON-formatted chunks (e.g., `{"chunk": "<text>"}`) rather than waiting for the complete response.
     - Supports an optional parameter (`flask_response`) that determines whether to wrap the generator in a Flask Response (useful for Server-Sent Events) or return the raw generator (for Gradio).

2. **PeopleAgent.py**
   - **Method:** `generate_response()`
   - **Summary:**
     - Updated to accept a `stream` flag.
     - When `stream=True`, it delegates the call to `generate_response_streaming()` (with `flask_response` set to False for Gradio).
     - Otherwise, it falls back to the non-streaming version of `generate_response()`.

   - **Method:** `process_query()`
   - **Summary:**
     - Simplified to call `_process_query_core()` asynchronously.
     - Now returns either a complete response or a streaming generator—eliminating any need for manual chunk simulation.

3. **UI_v3_native_streaming.py**

   - **Function:** `bot()`
   - **Summary:**
     - Adjusted to support native streaming responses.
     - When processing a query, the `bot` function now receives a streaming generator.
     - It iterates over the generator, decodes each JSON chunk, accumulates text, and progressively yields updates to the UI.
     - This real-time processing delivers a progressively updating chat display in Gradio.

## Overall Flow

- **Before:**  
  The code returned a complete text response (or simulated streaming by splitting a complete response into fixed-size chunks).

- **After:**  
  - **Native Streaming:**  
    Responses are generated in incremental chunks directly from Azure OpenAI using native streaming.
  - **Real-Time Update:**  
    Gradio receives and processes these incremental chunks in real time to update the chat display progressively.
  - **Integration Flexibility:**  
    The use of a `flask_response` flag allows seamless integration for both Flask (with Server-Sent Events) and Gradio environments.

## Summary

The migration from PeopleAgentV3 to PeopleAgentv3_native_streaming introduces a more responsive, debuggable, and maintainable approach to handling responses.
